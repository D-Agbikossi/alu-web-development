0. Structure: Create the most basic, simple and valid HTML file called base_index.html
The page should contain:
a DOCTYPE
a head:
with a title
a body
1. Make a cool first webpage: Copy your file base_index.html to index.html

Add in the body of the page:

at least 4 paragraphs;
headings (titles) of level 1, 2 and 3, which are represented by <h1>, <h2> and <h3> tags;
a clickable image of your choice (you can use the https://www.holbertonschool.com/holberton-logo.png image, or another one you find on the internet by using its full URL); and it may link to any URL online that you want.
